AutoProxy - the firefox proxy management add-on


Introduction
===
AutoProxy ==

  FoxyProxy (Use patterns to determine which or none proxy server to be used 
    when connecting, no need to switch status of proxy manually any more.) +

  Subscribe (Like Adblock Plus. Advanced users can share their patterns to the 
    whole world/country/school..., while normal users even don't need to know 
    what a pattern is, just subscribe to a maintained pattern list.) +
  
  Built-in Proxy Server (You also don't trouble to find and run a proxy server,
    here is a built-in one. Immediately work after install, no configuration
    needed -- Of course, you can turn it off and use another one.)




Where and How to Install
===
Install is very easy, just a click. Like other normal Firefox extensions.
